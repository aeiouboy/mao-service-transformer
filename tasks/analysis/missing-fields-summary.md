# Complete Missing Fields Analysis for 100% Pass Rate

## Summary
- **Total Missing Fields: 395** (not 371 as initially reported)
- **Categories: 6**
- **Current Pass Rate: 51.7%**
- **Target: 100% Pass Rate**

## Category Breakdown

### 1. ReleaseLine Fields (328 missing) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
The vast majority of missing fields are in the ReleaseLine section. This represents the bulk of the work needed.

### 2. OriginalPayload.Root Fields (51 missing)
Core payload fields including ProcessInfo, Note, and other root-level properties.

### 3. OrderExtension1.Extended Fields (11 missing)
```
1. SourceOrderShippingTotal (null)
2. AutoSettlement (null)
3. SourceOrderTotal (null)
4. T1ConversionRate (null)
5. Extended1 (null)
6. T1RedemptionPoint (null)
7. CustRef (null)
8. SourceOrderTotalDiscount (null)
9. T1Number (null)
10. T1PhoneNo (null)
11. SourceOrderSubTotal (null)
```

### 4. Order.Root Fields (2 missing)
```
1. OrderChargeDetail[1] with Extended properties
2. OrderChargeDetail[2] with Extended properties
```

### 5. Payment Fields (1 missing)
### 6. Other Fields (2 missing)

## Next Steps to Achieve 100% Pass Rate

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (13 fields)
Add the 11 OrderExtension1.Extended fields + 2 Order.Root fields as they are mostly null values.

### Phase 2: OriginalPayload.Root (51 fields)
Add missing ProcessInfo, Note, and other root-level fields.

### Phase 3: ReleaseLine Fields (328 fields)
This is the major effort - implement all missing ReleaseLine properties and structures.

### Phase 4: Final Fields (3 fields)
Complete remaining Payment and Other category fields.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Examine current transformation code** to understand existing structure
2. **Add missing fields systematically** starting with easiest categories
3. **Test incrementally** to track progress toward 100%
4. **Validate each category** before moving to the next
