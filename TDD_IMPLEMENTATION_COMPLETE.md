## 🗄️ Database Integration

### PostgreSQL Configuration
```typescript
{
  host: 'cg-omnia-psql-flex-nonprd.central.co.th',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'postgres',
  username: 'omniaqa',
  password: 'uYBXitqrwXU=25',
  type: 'postgres',
  synchronize: false,
  logging: true,
  ssl: false
}
```

### Database Schema Support
- ✅ **Orders Table**: Core order information with customer details
- ✅ **Order Lines Table**: Product line items with pricing and fulfillment
- ✅ **Payments Table**: Payment methods and transaction details
- ✅ **Allocations Table**: Inventory allocations by facility

### Query Optimization
- ✅ Efficient JOIN queries for related data loading
- ✅ Read-only access pattern for data safety
- ✅ Connection pooling and timeout management
- ✅ Proper error handling for database connectivity issues

## 📊 Business Rules Implementation

### Financial Calculations (CSV Compliant)
1. **Order Subtotal**: `SUM(OrderLine.Quantity * OrderLine.UnitPrice)` OR bundle calculations
2. **Total Charges**: Direct mapping from database charge records (CSV compliant)
3. **Tax Calculations**: Set to 0 (matches current implementation and target structure)
4. **Discounts**: Proportional allocation across lines (0.05% for orders ≥$100)
5. **Release Total**: `Subtotal + Charges + Taxes - Discounts`

### Transformation Rules
- ✅ All timestamps in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`)
- ✅ Monetary values with 2 decimal precision
- ✅ IDs follow pattern: `{entity}-{uuid}` (e.g., `REL-123`, `RL-456`)
- ✅ Addresses include MD5 hash generation for deduplication
- ✅ Status mapping follows MAO conventions

### Integration with Existing Services
- ✅ **TimestampService**: Consistent timestamp generation across system
- ✅ **CalculationService**: Financial calculation logic reuse
- ✅ **BusinessRulesService**: Shipping, tax, and discount rule application
- ✅ **DynamicIdGeneratorService**: Unique ID generation with counter management
